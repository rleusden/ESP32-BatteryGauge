# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Ways to contribute

- Improve Android legacy compatibility (4.x quirks)
- Add UART parsing features (more sensors, more fields)
- Improve channel selection heuristics
- Documentation: wiring, enclosure tips, external antenna notes
- UI improvements that still work on old WebKit browsers

## Guidelines

- Keep the HTML single-page and dependency-free
- Avoid modern JS/CSS that breaks on Android 4.x
- Prefer simple code over “clever” code (field repairs matter)

## Submitting changes

- Fork the repo
- Create a feature branch
- Open a PR with a clear description and test notes
